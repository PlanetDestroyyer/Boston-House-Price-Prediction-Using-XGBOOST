XGBoost, short for eXtreme Gradient Boosting, is a popular and powerful machine learning algorithm known for its efficiency and effectiveness in handling structured data. It belongs to the ensemble learning methods and is based on the gradient boosting framework.

Key features of XGBoost include:

1. **Gradient Boosting**: XGBoost builds a strong predictive model by combining multiple weak learners, typically decision trees, sequentially. Each new tree is trained to correct the errors of the previous trees, with a focus on reducing the residual errors.

2. **Regularization**: XGBoost offers built-in regularization techniques to prevent overfitting, such as L1 and L2 regularization. This helps in controlling the complexity of the model and improving its generalization performance.

3. **Handling Missing Values**: XGBoost has the capability to handle missing values internally, which can save preprocessing time and effort.

4. **Tree Pruning**: XGBoost prunes trees during the building process, which reduces complexity and prevents overfitting. It also includes a 'max_depth' parameter to control the depth of individual trees.

5. **Parallel Processing**: XGBoost supports parallel processing, making it efficient and scalable for large datasets. It can leverage multi-core CPUs for training and prediction tasks.

6. **Customization**: XGBoost provides flexibility in model tuning through various hyperparameters, allowing users to customize the model according to their specific needs. Hyperparameters include learning rate, number of trees, maximum depth of trees, and more.

XGBoost is widely used in various machine learning competitions and real-world applications due to its high predictive performance, scalability, and flexibility. It is effective for a wide range of tasks, including regression, classification, ranking, and recommendation systems.
